Major work done to framework outline

integration with metasploit has been done to an extent however ive been running into major limitations of the windows OS with the metasploit install and the fact many locations are hardcoded which would not have to have been if done on a linux system. This brings to thought about switching to a virtualised environment setup, although time costly might save in the long run.

setup local servers for requirements

thinking about ways to integrate RNN and random forest, as well as how to model them in the first place. Keras https://keras.io/ claims to be a prototyping aid for these kind of projects and it runs ontop of theano. Although ive already got theano running fine with my GPU on a windows environment it might be very helpful when i start writing the ML models if i can think of a way to integrate them with my currently non-existant dataset.

there is no way to directly script metasploit with python therefore there are many workaround solutions and msgrpc module is the one ive opted for at the moment.
