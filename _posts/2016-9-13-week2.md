title: Honours Project Update Week 2
---

Still thinking about project ideas, narrowed topic fields to the following:

- Counter intelligence
- Artificial Intelligence
- Programming
- Basic Electronics
- Hacking Framework
- Military Communications

still need to think of an idea and come up with an interesting research question.

update 2:

limited possible idea down to programming and hacking to try and think of an idea faster.
also nothing to do with IDS/IPS's.
