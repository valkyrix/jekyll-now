title: Honours Project Update Week 2
---

Still thinking about project ideas, narrowed topic fields to the following:

- Counter intelligence
- Artificial Intelligence
- Programming
- Basic Electronics
- Hacking Framework
- Military Communications

Still need to think of an idea and come up with an interesting research question.

#### Update 2:

limited possible idea down to programming and hacking to try and think of an idea faster.
also nothing to do with IDS/IPS's.

Ive been looking through a lot of online forums and spoken to a lot of popular netsec redditors to help me with ideas.
My ideal project would be able to make something that the community could use, or at the least advance a particular technology. 
Not just something that will be forgotten after the deadline.
