title: Honours Project Update Week 12
---

Creating ideas for feasibility demo.

Current options:

- Project plan Gantt chart including critical paths and sub methods
- Scripting Nessus with Metasploit example using nessus bridge.
- updated framework architecture
- RNN Theano demo
- integration with shodan API
- Convert architecture to use restful api to easily interface with shodan maybe.


The reason shodan has interested me is because of their exploit details in their API, it seems their restful api can return both vulnerability cve codes and exploits -> https://developer.shodan.io/api/exploit-specification
