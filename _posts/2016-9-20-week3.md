title: Honours Project Update Week 3
---

During this weeks workshop practical i managed to think up an idea which ticks all the boxes of what i wanted my idea to be, if not quite difficult to pull off.

The idea is to investigate using neural networking (such as tensorflow from google) and machine learning techniques (MLT) in the context of Red team. 
This is in the hopes of creating  a useful module or AI which can be used by the Red Team in capture the flag events. If successful an extention would be to have a comparison between running it on a GPU cluster (i.e. a large neural cluster vs small neural cluster).

A lot of research will need to be done in order to give me a basic starting point in MLT and Neural Networking using TensorFlow in order to actually incorporate them.

Working Title:

An investigation into using neural networking and Machine learning Techniques in the context of Red team.

AIM:

OBJECTIVES:

RESEARCH QUESTION:  

once im able to fill those fields ill create a powerpoint for this weeks workshop task.
