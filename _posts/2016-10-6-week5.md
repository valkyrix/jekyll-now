Practical and Evaluation Methods

- Research, analyse and document the current use of neural networks in the Cyber security sector.
- Design a useful offensive security tool using neural networks.
- Create it: Model and program the neural network then train it using rented cloud servers / GPU cluster.
- Test and evaluate it against popular wargame/CTF simulations.

### Extra Information
- Keeping it small. The goal is not to create a entire suite but rather a small useful tool that could be added to our repository.
- Depending on the intended purpose of the tool finding a dataset to train it might be difficult and will possibly be a determining factor.
- Will be using Googleâ€™s TensorFlow rather than Torch etc
