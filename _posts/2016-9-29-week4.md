title: Honours Project Update Week 4

Pretty much decided on TensorFlow as an API now (most likely using python)

Found many literature using neural networks for blue team activities such as NIDS's however almost no red team examples.

this is to the exception of 1 which is to use neural networks (The paper used Torch not tensorflow) in order to predict passwords from a small training set. That paper can be found here: 
- https://0day.work/using-neural-networks-for-password-cracking/
unfortunately i dont think this is a viable direction to take my project and will continue to search for a red teaming solution.

found out that Udacity do a course on deep learning (created by google and using tensorflow) which is free 
- https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730 This is probably a good place to start.
