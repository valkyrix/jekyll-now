title: Honours Project Update Week 9
---

Confirmed a project architecture to start on.

managed to get nessus api to create and run a scan using nessrest. It uses an existing policy but creates a new scan type.

need to figure out a way for it to output scan results in a machine readable way or to use the nestrest api to refer to the scans and their results via the api.

ATM it outputs scan ID and name.
